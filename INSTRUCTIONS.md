The hose adapter press fits into the end of the suction hose and press fits around the router dust outlet. 

Because the part is press fitting into a negitive pressure environment it's imporant that it be a snug fit.

The strain relief brackt then press fits around the hose itself and attaches to the sled with two 1-1/4 inch long screws.

Because plywood is vulnerable to splitting when screwed through the edge it is important to drill and countersink the screw holes before attaching the strain relief.
